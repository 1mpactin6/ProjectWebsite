Topic 2: Measures to Encourage Digital Literacy Among Youth to Bridge the Digital Divide

I. Background The digital divide represents one of the most pressing barriers to equitable development in the modern era, disproportionately affecting youth in underprivileged and marginalized communities. Historically, limited access to technology and digital education has perpetuated cycles of poverty, depriving these communities of opportunities for upward mobility. In today’s interconnected world, digital literacy is an essential skill for participating in education, employment, and civic life. Addressing the digital divide among youth is therefore critical to fostering inclusive economic growth and building a more equitable global society.

The COVID-19 pandemic further highlighted the urgency of addressing digital inequities. As education systems pivoted to online learning, students in low-income and rural areas faced significant challenges due to inadequate connectivity, lack of devices, and limited access to digital resources. This crisis underscored the need for scalable, innovative solutions that empower youth with the tools they need to thrive in a digital world.
