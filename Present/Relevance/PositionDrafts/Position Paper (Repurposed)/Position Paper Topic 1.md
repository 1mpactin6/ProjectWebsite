*Topic 1: Measures to Build Sustainable Digital Infrastructure to Enable AI-Driven Growth*

**Part A - Introduction:**

First and foremost, *Digital Infrastructure* refers to the *foundational technologies and systems*, such as *hardware* (physical) and *software* (digital). Providing the essential *data sharing and operations* for *storage* (Cloud Storage), *processing* (e.g. AI Computations), and *transmission* (Social Medias) of information, enabling the functioning and digital services (Websites) and applications (that require internet connection). Digital Infrastructure is essential for most operations on devices that requires connectivity, high performance, and large computations. As technology get more influenced, the importance of digital infrastructure becomes crucial. Secondarily, AI or *Artificial Intelligence*, is a *Generative, Pre-trained, and Transformer* (GPT) *Large Language Model* (LLM), that enables a wider range of technology development and related researches. Allowing the capabilities of *Embedding* (data analysis), Prompting (computing sequence), and RAG (small adjustments during the procedure). These capabilities can support and make it more convenient for humans during every type of growth. Ai and generate data for insights, processes, and enhance decision-making. As AI continue to evolve and improve, it will be more wide-spread.Last but not least, the connection between AI and *Digital Infrastructure* is vital. Currently, AI stands as one of the most influential technological developments globally. Organizations are increasingly implementing AI across their technologies, making humans smarter and more effective. A robust digital foundation will further enhance AI-driven growth, enabling collaboration and innovation.

**Part B - Stance and Actions:**

To this significant issue in building a sustainable and stable digital infrastructure, Mexico has implemented programs to extend and expand access to digital infrastructure, such as
