*On Measures to Encourage Digital Literacy Among the Youth to Bridge the Digital Divide*

**Honorable Chair, esteemed delegates, and distinguished guests, the delegate of Mexico is honored to speak today,**


The delegate of Mexico is aware of the importance of digital literacy among youth, and firmly believes that digital literacy is crucial for youth to fully participate in the modern world. Without access to technology and digital education, young people are left behind, unable to engage in the digital economy. To address this growing divide, we must ensure that digital skills are accessible to all youth, regardless of background.

In many regions, particularly rural and underserved areas, youth lack the resources and knowledge to thrive in a digital society. This perpetuates cycles of poverty and inequality. Without digital literacy, young people miss out on opportunities for education, employment, and personal growth, reinforcing global inequities.

To bridge this divide, we propose:

1. **Integrating digital skills into education**: Schools should teach coding, online safety, and problem-solving from an early age.
2. **Funding access programs**: Governments should provide subsidies for devices, internet access, and training in marginalized areas.
3. **Supporting youth-led innovations**: Youth-driven technological initiatives should be encouraged through mentorship, funding, and access to resources.

Mexico calls for international collaboration to close the digital divide and ensure that no child is left behind. Empowering youth with digital literacy will create a more inclusive, equitable society for all.
