**I. Position Statement**  
 The delegate of [**Country Name**] believes that building a sustainable digital infrastructure is one of the major challenges and opportunities facing the international community in the pursuit of AI-driven growth. As fellow delegates probably not have known, digital infrastructure is equivalent to the internet backbone, referring toÂ the digital technologies that provide the foundation for an organization's information technology and operations, showing the importance of digital infrastructure, and the core of chain effects. Without improving it and increasing the security and overall format overflow of the infrastructure, the digital world might fall at all time, vulnerable to attacks, and might easily be destroyed and injected malware.

 Currently, the uneven development of digital infrastructure across the globe limits the potential of AI technologies to foster economic and social progress, different countries have different technology development lacking the stability and sustainability of digital infrastructure globally. In many regions, inadequate connectivity, limited access to advanced computational resources, and insufficient integration of sustainable practices exacerbate inequality and hinder innovation. This situation impacts critical sectors, including healthcare, education, and industry, leading to a digital divide that stifles both development and global cooperation. The delegate hopes to collaborate with other delegates to create a final and comprehensive resolution!
