*Topic 2: Measures to Encourage Digital Literacy Among Youth to Bridge the Digital Divide*

**Honorable Chair, esteemed delegates, and distinguished guests, the delegate of Mexico is honored to speak today,**


The delegation of Mexico is honored to address the issue of digital literacy and its vital role in bridging the digital divide. As technology continues to shape the modern world, it is imperative that youth are equipped with the skills needed to engage in the digital economy, access education, and vital services. Without digital literacy, youth—particularly in underserved regions—are at a significant disadvantage.

The digital divide is not just about access to technology; it represents a deeper barrier to social and economic inclusion. Without the skills to navigate the digital world, many young people face exclusion from opportunities that technology offers, perpetuating cycles of inequality and poverty.

To address this, Mexico proposes the following measures:

1. **Integrating Digital Skills into Education**

- Include digital literacy training in school curriculums from an early age, covering coding, online safety, and information literacy.
- Ensure that youth are not only consumers of technology but also responsible digital citizens and creators of innovation.
- Provide digital skills training that prepares youth for future careers in technology and related fields.

2. **Expanding Access to Technology and Connectivity**

- Invest in programs that provide affordable or subsidized devices and internet access in underserved areas.
- Address the digital access gap by ensuring all youth, regardless of their economic background, have the tools to participate in the digital world.
- Support digital literacy training initiatives in rural and marginalized communities.

3. **Fostering Youth-Led Innovation and International Collaboration**

- Empower youth to drive technological change in their communities by supporting youth-led projects with mentorship and funding.
- Promote cross-border collaboration on digital literacy programs to share resources, knowledge, and best practices.
- Encourage youth entrepreneurship in digital fields, fostering creativity and local solutions to global challenges.

In conclusion, Mexico calls for international cooperation to bridge the digital divide and equip youth with the skills necessary to thrive in the digital era. Prioritizing digital literacy will help ensure no young person is left behind, allowing them to access the full potential of the digital world.

Thank you.
