**Model United Nations (MUN): A Comprehensive Knowledge Source**  
Model United Nations (MUN) is an educational simulation of the United Nations system, where participants assume the roles of diplomats representing countries, organizations, or historical figures to debate global issues, draft resolutions, and collaborate on solutions. It fosters skills in public speaking, negotiation, critical thinking, and diplomacy. Below, we explore MUN’s structure, objectives, and two illustrative examples: **SCIMUN** (Southern China International Model United Nations) and **World MUN** (upgraded from BFSUMUN, a prominent conference in China).
