_On Measures to Build Sustainable Digital Infrastructure to Enable AI-Driven Growth_

*Quick Summary:* Basically about the importance of digital backbone and to make it better and more sustainable (Think about the foundation/core)

**Respected Chair, Honorable Delegates, Distinguished Guests, and Esteemed Advisors, the delegate of [COUNTRY] is honored to speak today,**


**I. Position Statement**  
The delegate of [**Country Name**] believes that building a sustainable digital infrastructure is one of the *major challenges and opportunities facing by the international community*, in the pursuit of AI-driven growth=. ~~As fellow delegates probably have not known, digital infrastructure is equivalent to the internet backbone,~~ +Digital Infrastructure referring toÂ the digital technologies that provide the *foundation for an organization's information technology and operations*, showing the importance of digital infrastructure ~~showing the importance of digital infrastructure, and as the core of chain effects~~. Without *improving it and increasing the security and overall format overflow of digital infrastructure*, the digital world might fall at all time, vulnerable to attacks, and might easily be destroyed and injected malware. Therefore, the delegate believes that all nation should aware of this issue together.

**II. Problem Description**  
Currently, the uneven development of digital infrastructure across the globe, *limits the potential of AI technologies to foster economic and social progress*, emphasizing the inequality and lack of stability and sustainability. ~~which can include a lot considering that AI are pre-trained, generative, and transformer, different countries have different technology development lacking the stability and sustainability of digital infrastructure globally.~~ In many regions, *inadequate connectivity and integration across multi-regions, limited access to advanced computational resources such as NPUs or on-device AI, and insufficient integration of sustainable practices exacerbate inequality and hinder innovation* of not only AI but other difficult tasks involving technology. This situation not only impacts critical sectors, such as healthcare, education, and industry, but is also leading to a digital divide that suppresses both development and global cooperation, seeing all these, the delegate hopes that all nation collaborate together to overcome this huge challenge. The delegate hopes to incorporate with other delegates to create a final and comprehensive resolution!

**III. Suggestions and Action Plan**  
To address this challenge, [**Country Name**] proposes the following actionable measures:

1. **Investment in Green and Inclusive Technology**: Encourage the use of renewable energy sources for data centers and digital infrastructure to reduce carbon footprints while ensuring accessibility in underserved regions (or LEDCs).
2. **Public-Private Partnerships**: Establish collaborative frameworks between governments and technology industries to fund and expand robust, scalable digital networks.
3. **Policy Frameworks and Knowledge Sharing**: Develop international policies and share best practices on sustainable AI infrastructure development, ensuring inclusivity and respect for independence.

These suggestions **uphold** the lack of sustainability in digital infrastructure, fixing issues of technology instability and eventually hindering innovation. The delegate would welcome for alliances and further consultation on other ways to solve this issue, or further collaborate on these suggestions.

**IV. Call for Cooperation**

The delegate calls on all nations to collaborate on *building a resilient and sustainable digital infrastructure*, leveraging collective resources and knowledge to empower AI-driven growth. The delegate would allow any type of alliance where we are meant to solve this problem collaboratively. Only through such cooperation can we unlock the full potential of AI for a more equitable and prosperous future.
