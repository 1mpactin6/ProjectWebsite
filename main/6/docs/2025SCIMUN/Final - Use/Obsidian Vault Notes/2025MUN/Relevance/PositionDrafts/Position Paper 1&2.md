**Country**: [Country Name]  
**Committee**: United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)  
**Topic 1**: Measures to Build Sustainable Digital Infrastructure to Enable AI-Driven Growth

---

**I. Background**

_Artificial intelligence (AI)_ is a transformative force reshaping the global socio-economic landscape, driving innovation, and offering unparalleled opportunities for development. However, the uneven distribution of digital infrastructure—including _high-speed connectivity_, _advanced data centers_, and _robust cloud computing systems_—has perpetuated inequalities between nations and regions.

Historically, regions with insufficient digital capabilities have been excluded from the benefits of technological revolutions, further entrenching socio-economic disparities. Today, this technological divide continues to constrain the ability of many nations to harness AI’s potential fully, thereby impeding collective efforts to address global challenges. **Building sustainable, inclusive, and resilient digital infrastructure** is critical to bridging this gap and unlocking AI-driven growth for all.

Moreover, sustainable digital infrastructure must address the **environmental concerns** associated with expanding technological capabilities. The _energy-intensive nature_ of data centers, alongside the _environmental degradation_ caused by inefficient practices, raises questions about the long-term viability of unregulated expansion. Countries must now navigate a dual challenge: achieving technological advancement while ensuring _environmental sustainability_. This requires a deliberate and coordinated approach that leverages _green energy sources_, promotes innovation in _energy efficiency_, and prioritizes _social equity_.

**II. Country’s Position**

**Country’s Interests:**  
[Country Name] recognizes _AI_ as a cornerstone of modern economic development and societal progress. It seeks to harness AI to drive innovation, enhance public services, and foster economic resilience. However, achieving these objectives necessitates **equitable access** to advanced digital infrastructure. This is particularly vital for underserved regions where _poverty_ and _limited connectivity_ exacerbate developmental challenges. Additionally, [Country Name] prioritizes **environmentally sustainable solutions** to mitigate the ecological footprint of expanding digital networks and facilities.

**Actions Taken:**  
[Country Name] has initiated comprehensive programs to **expand broadband access**, promote **green data centers**, and advance domestic **AI research** and development. These initiatives are complemented by international partnerships aimed at sharing best practices and providing technical support to regions lacking adequate digital infrastructure.

To date, [Country Name] has also made significant strides in promoting _renewable energy_ use in data centers, deploying nationwide _5G networks_, and incentivizing the private sector to invest in sustainable technology solutions.

**Main Perspectives:**  
[Country Name] asserts that the global community must prioritize the development of **sustainable** and **equitable** digital infrastructure. Key challenges include the _high energy demands_ of data centers, the _digital divide_ between urban and rural areas, and the need for investments that align with **environmental** and **social equity** goals.
