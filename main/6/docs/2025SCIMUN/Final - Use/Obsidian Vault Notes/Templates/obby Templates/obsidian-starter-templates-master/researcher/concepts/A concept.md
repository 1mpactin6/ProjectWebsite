# A new useful concept
- [[Saini (2017) – Inferior]] described it like this, but [[Csikszentmihalyi (2008) – Flow]] described it like that.

## More detail
This link appears many times,[^repeated] so uses a footnote. A reference[^repeated] had an even different idea to [[Csikszentmihalyi (2008) – Flow]]. 

This concept only appeared once, so just paste link.

[[Templates/obby Templates/obsidian-starter-templates-master/researcher/people/Collaborator A]] has a good idea about this, but [[Templates/obby Templates/obsidian-starter-templates-master/researcher/people/Supervisor]] thinks that this is wrong. I need to check.[^repeated]
