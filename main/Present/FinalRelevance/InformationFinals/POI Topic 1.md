6. **Questioning Environmental Impact Despite Sustainability Claims:**
    
    - _"Honorable delegate, while you’ve outlined the need for sustainable AI infrastructure, your proposal fails to address the massive environmental costs of building such infrastructure. How do you plan to mitigate the carbon emissions associated with the extensive mining of materials needed for AI hardware?"_
    
7. **Challenging the Feasibility of Global Cooperation:**
    
    - _"Esteemed delegate, while your speech advocated for global cooperation, it seems unrealistic for all nations to align on a single framework for AI infrastructure, especially considering the wide disparities in technological capabilities. How do you propose to overcome these deep gaps in infrastructure readiness?"_
    
8. **Doubts About Inclusivity in Development:**
    
    - _"Delegate, while your country’s focus on inclusivity is laudable, your speech didn’t mention how your country plans to overcome the severe digital gaps between urban and rural populations. How do you justify promoting AI infrastructure when so many are still without basic internet access?"_
    
9. **Questioning Data Security Implementation:**
    
    - _"Honorable delegate, while your focus on data privacy is admirable, how do you plan to prevent data breaches in AI systems, especially in countries where the regulatory frameworks are either lacking or insufficient to deal with such massive amounts of personal data?"_
    
10. **Concerns About Scalability and Economic Feasibility:**
    
    - _"Esteemed delegate, your proposal to scale sustainable AI infrastructure globally seems overly optimistic, especially given the financial constraints of many countries. How does your country plan to address the high cost of building such infrastructure in economically weaker nations?"_
