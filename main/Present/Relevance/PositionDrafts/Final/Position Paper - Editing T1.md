*Topic 1: Measures to Build Sustainable Digital Infrastructure to Enable AI-Driven Growth*

**Part A - Background**:

AI, a *generative*, *pre-trained*, and *transformer* Large Language Model, is a powerful force that significantly transformed and reshaped the world. Offering not only unlimited opportunities for technology development and related researches, but also another important technological upgrade of human society. However, AI require servers and the collection of hardware and software to power. In other words, in order to both benefit the implementation of AI and the overall impact on the environment, a different method of energy consuming is required.

The deep connection of AI-powering with digital infrastructure, shows how important is a sustainable and stable digital infrastructure. As that the digital infrastructure provides in major operation of informational technology. The run button of a series of simple code requires a lot of computing points, and as technology and AI advances, the attention to the usage of power will quickly appear.

Digital infrastructure not only requires to address environment issues, but also expanding technology capabilities, more computing points and faster chips are required. The addition of better GPUs (*graphics processing unit*), CPUs (*central processing unit*), TPUs (*Tensor Processing Units*), DPUs (*_data processing units_*), QPUs (*quantum processing unit), and NPUs (neural processing unit), are required.

**v1:** First and foremost, this topic focuses on emphasizing the importance of AI-technology, on how to further support and strengthen AI by building a sustainable and stable Digital Infrastructure. AI, *Artificial Intelligent*, is a *Generative, Pre-trained, and Transformer* (GPT) *Large Language Model* (LLM) that requires a lot of tokens (or computing points). These AIs as the embedding data (Training Information) and transformer procedure (Thinking) gets more and more complicated, AI will require more computing points, and better Processing Units (Including GPUs (*graphics processing unit*), CPUs (*central processing unit*), TPUs (*Tensor Processing Units*), DPUs (*_data processing units_*), QPUs (*quantum processing unit), and NPUs (neural processing unit)).

**v2:** This topic primarily emphasizes the significance of AI technology and the need to enhance and sustain it through the development of a robust digital infrastructure. AI, or *Artificial Intelligence*, refers to *Generative Pre-trained Transformers* (GPT), which are a type of *Large Language Model* (LLM) that relies heavily on tokens (or computing points). As the complexity of the embedding data (training information) and transformer processes (thinking) increases, AI will demand more computing points and improved processing units. This includes various types of processing units such as GPUs (*graphics processing units*), CPUs (*central processing units*), TPUs (*Tensor Processing Units*), DPUs (*data processing units*), QPUs (*quantum processing units*), and NPUs (*neural processing units*).

Secondarily, AI is a powerful force that significantly reshape our universe, it not only contribute in various researches and offers unlimited opportunities
